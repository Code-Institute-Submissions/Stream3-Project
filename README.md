# Code Institute Stream 3 Project

## Overview
This code is for a site that is required for the Code Institute end of Stream 3 (Full Stack Frameworks) project. It is to demonstrate an ability to code, test and deploy (to GitHub) a full stack website that follows good practice. The website has the dual purpose of covering examination requirements while also illustrating my level of knowledge/competency to prospective employers.

## Project Coding
#### Technologies used
- HTML
- CSS
	- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
- JavaScript 
- Jasmine (https://jasmine.github.io/)
- Python (https://www.python.org/)
	- Django Framework (https://www.djangoproject.com/)

#### Coding concepts used/followed
nnnnnnnnnn

#### 3rd party code used:
- I used a default bootstrap responsive menu, although I have adapted it from its default design to make it more responsive. In this site the text shown on the menu will change size depending on the viewing device. In addition, where applicable, I changed the default Bootstrap div elements as HTML5 semantic elements for improved usability.

django-paypal (0.4.1)
easy-thumbnails (2.5)
Pillow (4.3.0)

#### Justification of approach
- **** While cart based apps were available, I wanted to develop my own so that I had the opportunity to develope from "the ground up", and alo it would allow me to tailor the app to my specific requirements.





## How was the project deployed

## How was the project tested
- 

### Testing code quality
I validated the HTML used through https://validator.w3.org

### Testing Responsive Design:
I have tested the website, across different devices, different browsers and different Operating Systems, to ensure that the site adapts cleanly/neatly to the different device criteria, summary of what I tested is below (limited to what I had available):
- iPhone: Firefox, Chrome, Opera
- Samsung phone: Firefox, Chrome, Opera
- iPad: Firefox, Chrome, Opera
- Laptop Win10: Firefox, Chrome, Opera (resizing browser window to check scalability)
- Desktop OS X Mavericks: Firefox, Chrome, Opera (resizing browser window to check scalability)

### Functional Testing
The key elements of the testing were the different aspects of the "user story", which in essence was checking that the functionality that the user would need to use to achieve their goal, in this case looking at my photos and finding out a bit about me) worked, so I checked: 
 - The navigation links
 - External link (on homepage)
 - The photo viewer
- The contact form

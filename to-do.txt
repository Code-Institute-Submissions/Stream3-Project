Design!



----------------
Cut up wood for loft room, panel per panel




Longer screws (better load baring and also potential for better masonary)
No more nails

--------------


Remember small laptop for Viks Dad



--------------------------------------
On form, need to make zero default, 
but then use basket amount
-----------------------------------------





Sorting out, from products list, getting items into basket
Then basket list
May need to clear out the basket and basket-item tables when testing

Then:

cart_add function), then sort out cart list page:
	- update item (amount)
	- delete item
 	- refresh list 







-------------------
Cart app needs:
	- Amend amount function
	- List function
	- Delete cart function


Product app needs
	- List All
	- Filtering, as per Timmy showed

 - Doing what Timmy suggested on site

Redo all URLS and sort each app out as individual package


Layout of site, write down

- I have  step up job-wise and taking risks-wise, Kove deserves more and I will be left behind otherwise, KICK ON FOR SELF, NOT FAR OFF!!
- Write out what was, and what is love for me
